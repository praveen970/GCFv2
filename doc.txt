Project Specification for TripsTracker
Project Title: TripsTracker

Project Description:
TripsTracker is an Android application that leverages Google Maps and location services to allow users to navigate and track locations dynamically. It facilitates outdoor activities, travel planning, and real-time location-based coordination among user groups by providing two distinct modes of operation: Group Mode and Server Mode.

Objective:
To provide a versatile map-based navigation app that supports:

Collaborative destination and place management in Group Mode.
Controlled management by a single user in Server Mode.
Target Audience:

Travel groups and families planning and managing trips together.
Event organizers needing controlled navigation settings for participants.
Adventure groups such as hikers or cyclists needing synchronized location tracking.
Features:

Map and Location Integration:

Embed and interact with Google Maps.
Real-time GPS tracking with location updates.
Two Operational Modes:

Group Mode: All members can add or modify destinations and these changes sync across all users in the group.
Server Mode: Designated 'server' user controls destination settings, with other users viewing updates but unable to make changes.
Search and Navigation:

Use Google Places API for robust search functionality.
Provide directions and navigation options to selected destinations.
Interactive Markers and Places:

Users can place and edit markers that sync across the group in Group Mode.
In Server Mode, only the server can place or modify markers.
Real-Time Syncing:

Changes in one userâ€™s app reflected in real-time for others via Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
User Authentication and Group Management:

Secure user authentication mechanism.
Ability to create and manage groups, assigning roles where applicable.
UI Components:

Customizable user interface adapting to the selected mode.
Dialogs and notifications for real-time interaction and feedback.
Security and Permissions Management:

Manage permissions within the app for different roles.
Ensure data transmission and storage are secure.
Technology Stack:

Programming Language: Kotlin
Android SDK: Compatibility up to Android API level 21.
Libraries and APIs:
